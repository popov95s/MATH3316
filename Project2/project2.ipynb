    "### 1. Vandermonde Matrix\n",
    "For the first part of this project, we were to write a C++ program vandermonde.cpp that would solve a linear system $ Ax=b $ with the Vandermonde matrix A of order n as the coefficient matrix for each $ n = 5, 9, 17, 33, 65 $. The Vandermonde matrix A, which is a well-known ill-conditioned matrix, was to be generated by the vector $v$ with $n$ equally-spaced entries between 0 and 1 (including 0 and 1). A random vector $x$ with $n$ random entries was generated using a built-in function of the provided Matrix class.The vector $b$ was then constructed, so that $x$ would be the solution to $Ax=b$. The general linear solver in the Matrix class was used to find the solution $\\hat{x}$ of $Ax=b$. We were then to find the 2-norm of the error vector and residual vector.\n"
